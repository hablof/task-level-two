I see you, you see me
How pleasant, this feeling
The moment you hold me
I missed you, I'm sorry
I've given what I have
I showed you I'm growing
The ashes fall slowly
As your voice consoles me
[Chorus] (Припев)
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
